Restaurants often lack visibility into what drives sales performance. Raw sales data doesn’t easily answer:
Which pizzas are the most popular?
What categories generate the highest revenue?
Which time of day has peak sales?
Does pizza size influence revenue?

• Goal of the Dashboard
To provide a data-driven sales analysis tool that:
✔ Identifies best-selling pizzas by quantity & revenue.
✔ Compares sales across categories and sizes.
✔ Analyzes time-based trends (daily, monthly, hourly).
✔ Supports business strategy decisions for menu optimization and promotions.
